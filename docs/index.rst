Welcome to Farmer.Chat
====================
FarmStack is a content sharing platform designed by DigitalGreen, a not for profit organization to help smallholder farmers. Integrating an AI ChatBot with FarmStack could further improve this initiative by providing an interactive, on-demand tool for farmers to get immediate responses to their queries, advice on farming techniques, weather updates, market prices, and more. 

This Hackathon event is designed for students eager to engage with cutting-edge software development in the agriculture domain. The spotlight will be on "AI powered FarmStack," an open-source platform that integrates an AI ChatBot to provide tailored, real-time advice to farmers.

This documentation gives an overview of the Farmer.Chat code bundle. The 'Classes', 'Methods' and files involved of this package are briefly explained.
